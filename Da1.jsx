// React -> Js Framework, -> Fast
// HTML + CSS + JS < ReactJs

// Html -> .html <body></body>
// css -> .css <style></style>
// js -> .js <script></script>

// React -> css -> style.module.css || style.css
//       -> .jsx -> index.jsx
//       -> jsx -> Javascript Xml -> html + CSS + Javascript code

// ** Advantages/benefits of using ReactJs -> 

//    1. Fast loading code,
//    2. Javascript Framework,
//    3. We can write html, css, and js code in a single line in a single file,
//    4. We can use different css libraries to make our UI look good, ex; Chakra UI, Material UI, Talwind css, Bootstrap.,

//    5. 
//    index.js -> Parent code.
//    App.js   -> Parent code.

//    * Commands 
//    1. Create a react app -> npx create-react-app app-name
//    2. cd root directory -> head over to the root directory
//    3.  npm start -> to run your react app.


//    * You want to make 20 pages:
//    1. Create Different Components folder
//    2. Create your files inside the Components

//    * .jsx file structure
//    1. import React from 'react'
//    2. Make Function
//    3. Export
//    4. import function in App and use it

//    * useState hook
//    1. hook function that used to store the data and update the data;
//    2. you'll have to import useState from react,
//    3. syntax -> 
//    const [name, setName] = useState("Amzad");
//    console.log(name) -> Amzad;

//    * useEffect ->
//    1. Run all the code only once







//  Introduction of React

//  React is a library that allows you to create a web application that is fast, efficient, and user-friendly. It is a JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. It is a library that allows you to create a web application that is fast, efficient, and user-friendly. It is a library that allows you to.

//  React Owner --> FaceBook

//  1. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

// 2. React is used to build single-page applications.

// 3. React allows us to create reusable UI Components.



//  What is React ?

// 1. React is a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. it lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "Components".

// 2. React, sometimes referred to as a Frontend javascript Framework, is a JavaScript library created by FaceBook.

// 3. React is a tool for build UI components.



//  How does React Work

// Instead of manipulating the DOM directly, React uses virtual DOM to create a virtual representation of the DOM. This virtual DOM is then compared to the real DOM to determine if any changes need to be made. This comparison is done using a virtual DOM diff algorithm.


// React.JS was first released in 2006. React.JS was first used in 2011 for FaceBook's Newsfeed feature.

//  create-react-app includes built tools such as webpack, Babel and ESLint.

//  FaceBook software engineer, "jordan walke", created React.Js.


//  Declarative Approach :-  You tell the browser exactly what to do, instead of telling it what you need. the React declarative Approach abstracts that for us.

// with declarative code, we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps.
